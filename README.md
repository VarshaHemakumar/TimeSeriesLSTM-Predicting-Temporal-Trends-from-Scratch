# TimeSeriesLSTM: Predicting Temporal Trends from Scratch

This project implements and compares deep learning architectures — RNN and LSTM — for univariate and multivariate time-series forecasting. Using PyTorch, the models are trained from scratch on a real-world dataset to capture temporal dependencies and predict future values with high accuracy.

---

##  Objective

- Develop LSTM-based models for sequential data prediction.
- Explore sliding window techniques to reframe time-series as supervised learning.
- Apply normalization, early stopping, and model checkpointing.
- Compare RNN and LSTM in terms of convergence, metrics, and performance.

##  Dataset

- **Type**: Time-series data with numerical features  
- **Domain**: *(replace with actual — e.g., Retail Sales, Energy, Air Quality, etc.)*  
- **Source**: *(UCI / Kaggle / Web — include link if public)*  
- **Preprocessing Steps**:
  - Missing value handling (e.g., forward fill)
  - Normalization (MinMaxScaler / StandardScaler)
  - Sequential split: 70% train, 15% val, 15% test
  - Sliding window sequence generation

##  Sequence Preparation

We use a sliding window approach to generate sequences:

```python
def create_sequences(data, seq_length):
    xs, ys = [], []
    for i in range(len(data) - seq_length):
        x = data[i:(i + seq_length)]
        y = data[i + seq_length]
        xs.append(x)
        ys.append(y)
    return np.array(xs), np.array(ys)
```

##  Model Architectures

###  RNN (Baseline)
- Stacked `nn.RNN` layers  
- Tanh activation  
- Dropout for regularization  
- Linear projection layer  

###  LSTM Model
- 3+ stacked `nn.LSTM` layers  
- Dropout for regularization  
- Fully connected output layer  
- Unidirectional / Bidirectional variants  

---

##  Experiment Variants

- Hidden Units: 64, 128  
- Sequence Lengths: 10, 20, 50  
- Dropout: 0.2, 0.5  
- Optimizers: Adam, SGD  
- Learning Rates: 0.001, 0.0005  
- Early stopping based on validation loss  
- Hyperparameter tuning: manual & grid search  

---

##  Training Setup

- **Loss Function**: `MSELoss` (regression)  
- **Optimizer**: Adam / SGD  
- **Early Stopping**: patience = 10  
- **Checkpointing**: saves best validation model  
- **Reproducibility**: `torch.manual_seed()` and `random.seed()`

##  Evaluation Metrics

### For Regression Tasks:
- MAE – Mean Absolute Error  
- RMSE – Root Mean Squared Error  
- R² – Coefficient of Determination  

### For Classification (if applicable):
- Accuracy  
- Precision, Recall, F1-score  
- Confusion Matrix

##  Sample Results

| Model | MAE | RMSE | R² Score |
|-------|-----|------|----------|
| RNN   | 0.45| 0.58 | 0.71     |
| LSTM  | 0.31| 0.42 | 0.86     |

>  **LSTM significantly outperforms RNN** in forecasting precision and model stability.

##  Key Takeaways

- LSTM is more effective for capturing long-range dependencies than vanilla RNN.  
- Dropout and early stopping improve generalization.  
- Optimal sequence length is crucial: too short loses context, too long overfits.  
- Visual diagnostics improve interpretability and performance tuning.
